<h2 id='visualize_propane_price_history'>Visualize Propane price history</h2>

<p>Consumer propane prices are highly variable. Like most consumers I prefer to buy when prices are low. But how to know when prices are at their lowest? This application looks at price history from my local propane supplier <a href='http://www.co-openergy.org/prices.html'>&#8220;co-op energy&#8221;</a> to help.</p>

<p>I used</p>

<ul>
<li>Nokogiri</li>

<li>Sinatra</li>

<li>Datamapper</li>

<li>Flot</li>

<li>jQuery</li>

<li>Haml/Sass</li>

<li>And Heroku</li>
</ul>

<p>to build it.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s a big pile of software to build a &#8220;simple&#8221; Sinatra app. I wanted to compare the &#8220;ease&#8221; of building small apps with Sinatra vs Rails. My conculsion: In this case Sinatra is easier on the computer. But, once you get Haml/Sass, Datamapper, Migrations, Views and models in their own directories, etc, It&#8217;s not much easier for me. An instance of the app is deployed here:</p>
